**Without fail cooking ultimate My Bacon, onion, Tomato &amp; Cheese Omelette easy, bouncy, practical**. This is both one of the most basic pasta dishes, and one of my favorites. Instead of simmering tomato sauce for hours on end, this can be thrown together in a matter of minutes. Instead of simply sauteing the onion in olive oil or bacon fat, the onions are first softened in water, which eventually evaporates. Slowly caramelized onions, fresh ripe tomatoes, gruyere cheese and BACON. Freshly sliced tomatoes tend to be watery, so the real effort (which was minimal) came from removing the seeds from the sliced tomatoes and salting them to draw out any excess moisture.
