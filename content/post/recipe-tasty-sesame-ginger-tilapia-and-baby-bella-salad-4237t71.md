Tilapia has a reputation as a somewhat, ahem, boring fish, like a high school English teacher with a monotone teaching The Great Gatsby for the millionth time.

My decision to devote this week&#39;s recipes to salad dressings was partly a reaction to my son&#39;s request for a bottled sesame ginger dressing.

Toss mixed greens and carrots with sesame ginger dressing.

Serve salmon on bed of greens, garnish with green onions and drizzle with remaining dressing.

Whisk all the dressing/dipping sauce ingredients together until.
