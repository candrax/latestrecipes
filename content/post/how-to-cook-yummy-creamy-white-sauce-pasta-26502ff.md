Creamy white sauce pasta aka béchamel sauce pasta is one of my favorite pasta recipes.

It&#39;s cheesy and oh so good!

Classic béchamel sauce is made with butter, flour and milk.

For this pasta, I add cream and this pasta is super cheesy and creamy, just like my family likes it.

Use this seasoned sauce to top pizza or pasta.
