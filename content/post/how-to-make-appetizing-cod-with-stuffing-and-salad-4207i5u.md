**Without fail cooking ultimate cod with stuffing and salad easy, fast, practical**. I was skeptical of the celery salad not having many ingredients but it was the perfect side to the fish. And the garlic and curry went wonderfully with cod. Used frozen cod (not much fresh seafood swimming around in AZ )and served with plain white rice so as not to distract from the unique flavors. For the potato salad, bring a pot of salted water to the boil, add the potatoes and cook until soft. Use a peeler to create thin strands from the outside of the cucumber, reserve this to Mix with the pickling liquid.
