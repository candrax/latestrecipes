### Process Cooking Non Veg Taco Mexicana

{{< adstxt />}}


1. Firstly wash the chicken pieces well. Then chop the chicken into very small pieces and add it into a grinder..



1. Then add ginger-garlic paste, oil/ghee, garlic powder, salt, chilli sauce, vinegar, soya sauce, chopped onion, chopped green chillies, oregano herbs &amp; chilli flakes. Then grind it well. Now spread it evenly into a square mould and press it gently as shown in the image below. Keep it in a refrigerator for about an hour..



1. Till the time the salami is setting, add maida, salt, crushed ajwain in a large bowl. Mix everything well and Knead a soft dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and keep it aside for half an hour..



1. After an hour, remove the salami tray and cut them into pieces as in Domino&#39;s they do. Then wrap each one of them separately with an alluminium foil as shown in the image below..



1. Now place a large bowl of water. When the water starts boiling, drop the salami pieces wrapped in alluminium foil, into it. Now let it boil on medium flame for about 10 to 12 mins. Then remove them from the boiling water and remove them from the alluminium foil too..



1. Now shallow fry each salami by turning up and down for about a minute or 2. Then remove it from the flame. Keep it aside..



1. Now make 4 balls out of the dough and roll each one of it as thin as possible. Brush some oil over it and sprinkle some dry flour over it. Now make vertical cuts over the chapati with a knife or pizza cutter as shown in the image below. Very gently try to accumulate all the chapati-strings with a knife..



1. After accumulating, brush some more oil over the strings. By applying oil, you can see the layers on your taco/parathas. Now pull from both the sides on the outer direction. It would become slightly longer. Then roll it by tucking the sides inside..



1. Now roll it with a rolling pin or if possible use your hand for rolling, by giving gentle pressure over the taco. Use the same method with the rest of the balls. Keep it aside. But roll each one of them only few minutes back, before placing it over the pan. If you roll all the lachcha parathas at the same time, they would get stick to each other. So roll each of them and quickly place it over the tawa..



1. Thaw it 50 percent only. Then remove it, put a salami inside it, apply some harissa sauce on the top and back of the salami. If you don&#39;t have harissa sauce, in a bowl, add 2 tbsp of any mayo that you have and 1 tbsp of tomato ketchup. Mix it well and use it as harissa sauce. Now put some shredded mozzarella cheese over it. Sprinkle with some oregano &amp; chilli flakes..



1. Then fold it half &amp; place it over a hot tawa. Thaw it well from both the sides, until it turns golden brown and crispy from both the sides. Sprinkle some oregano and chilli flakes over it. Do it in same method, with the rest of the parathas to make perfect tacos. Your non-veg Taco Mexicana are now ready to serve. Enjoy this recipe with your loved ones...
