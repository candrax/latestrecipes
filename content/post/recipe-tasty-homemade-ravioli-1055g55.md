      - Weigh the flour and place it in a mound on a wooden board Make a well in the middle and add the eggs one at a time each time using a fork to combine the egg with the flour to make a thick paste 
      - Bring the mixture together into a dough and knead for at least 10 minutes until the dough is springy You can test it by pushing it with your finger It should bounce back to its original shape 
      - Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 30 mins 
      - Then prepare your dough for the machine by rolling it with a rolling pin Then pass it though the pasta roller on its widest setting My machine had 9 settings I started at 1 and passed the dough 3 times through each level before moving onto the next I ended up going up to level 6 before deciding it was just thin enough You want to be able to clearly see a shadow through the dough 
      - Tips Make sure you keep your surface covered in flour to prevent sticking and if the strips of dough get too long just cut them in half 
      - Once your dough is rolled add your filling Be careful not to overload the ravioli Place small balls of filling evenly spaced along the strip of dough Then brush the sides with water before placing the other strip of dough on top Youve got to work quickly and push as much air out of the ravioli parcels as possible before sticking Then with a knife pasta cutter or other implement cut into ravioli shapes          see recipe 
      - Once ready to cook bring a pan of water to the boil and cook the ravioli for 3 12 minutes I did 6 at a time Once cooked Remove from the water drain and eat immediately
