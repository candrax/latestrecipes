      - Cover with foil and refridgerate for 5 hours or over night 
      - You will be labeling out spoonfuls of this dish as servings  You cant cut it into pieces  Just spoon it out into a bowl 
      - You can do chocolate pudding if youd like but i like the contrast of colors because you can see the layers in the dish  I dont like to over power the chocolate flavor of the oreos
