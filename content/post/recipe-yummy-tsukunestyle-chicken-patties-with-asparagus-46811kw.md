Japanese Chicken Meatballs called &#39;Tsukune&#39; are one of the regular yakitori dish items.

Soft and bouncy chicken meatballs are skewered and chargrilled with sweet soy sauce, i.e. yakitori sauce.

The key to my soft and juicy meatballs is the grated onion and the amount of fat in the chicken mince.

Often times, small Tsukune meat balls are skewered on bamboo sticks and Ground chicken is the main ingredient for Tsukune.
