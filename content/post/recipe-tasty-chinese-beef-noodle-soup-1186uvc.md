### Process Cooking Chinese Beef Noodle Soup

{{< adstxt />}}


1. (optional) For extra beefy flavour, make beef stock with the bones by boiling them in water with your largest stock pot. After about 5 minutes there will be a lot of scum on top, so use a strainer to skim off the scum every couple of minutes until the stock produces no more foam. It should look a bit green and oily when finished (see pic). Reduce heat to keep it simmering for 1-3 hrs to extract maximum flavour. Alternatively, you can skip this step just use water.



1. While stock is simmering, blanch your beef to remove impurities. In a clean pot, boil just enough water to cover your beef and then add the beef and keep it boiling for 1-2 minutes. Remove the beef, rinse in clean water, cut into eating sized chunks. Discard the scummy water from this step..
