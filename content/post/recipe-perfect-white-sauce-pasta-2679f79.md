### Stages Cooking White Sauce Pasta

{{< adstxt />}}


1. Boil the pasta with some salt and very little oil. Boil it only 80-90%. Here I have taken three types of pasta - Penne, Farfalle(bow tie shaped) and Rotini(swirl shaped pasta). The brand is Delmonte. It&#39;s suji base pasta and much better then all purpose flour based pasta. The sooji pasta has more body then the maida pasta. I recommend to use sooji pasta. You can cook with only 1 type of pasta as well. Usually it&#39;s Penne..



1. Now once pasta is boiled, strain it. Donot throw away the water. It will be required later on..



1. Now cut onion, brocolli, carrot, capsicum like shown in the image below. You can use more veggies like red and yello bell peppers, mushrooms, french beans, baby corn,black olives..



1. Chop ginger and garlic. Take a pan and add some olive oil(recommended for italian cooking). Add chopped ginger and garlic to the pan. Now add onion slices. Cook it for around 30 sec. Now add the veggie which takes the most long time to cook. I have added brocolli and carrot and this stage. Stir Fry it for around 2-3 minutes. Now add capsicum. add 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper powder. Stir fry the veggies for another 2-3 minutes. Donot overcook the veggies as pasta should have a bite..



1. Some crunchiness should be there in veggies. Time to prepare the sauce. Now take a sauce pan and keep it on the lowest heat. Add 2 tbsp butter with some little olive oil. as soon as butter is melted, add 1 1/2 tbsp maida/cornflour and keep on mixing it with the help of whisk. Please make sure the maida is not overcooked and doesnot turn brown..



1. Mix it for another 30 secs. Now we need to add milk around 500 gms. But we donot need to add the whole milk at one go. Add some little amount of milk and mix it well with the help of whisk. Keep on mixing until there is no lump. Now If milk is cold, warm the milk. warm milk reduces the chance of making lumps in the sauce. Once milk is mixed thouroghly, add the remaining milk and mix it well with whisk. Again, make sure there are no lumps..



1. At first the sauce will be thin, but when it cooks eventually on low heat, it will turn thick. keep on mixing the sauce in between..Now when sauce starts to turn little thicker, add 2-3 cheese slices. You can also agg some grated mozerella cheese or 2-3 garted cheese cubes. You can combine 2 different cheese as well. Now let the cheese melt and mix it in the sauce. As sauce turns more thicker, now add salt to taste,1 tsp black pepper powder, 2-3 tsp oregano seasoning,,2-3 tsp red chilli flakes.



1. Mix the seasonings well in the sauce. Now at this stage we need to add some garted nutmeg(powder) in the sauce..This will enhance the complete flavour of the sauce and will add aroma into it. Add atleast half grated nutmeg. now check the sauce with spoon. Please see the below image. dip spoon in the sace, take it out and wipe the back side of spoon. If this is how it looks, your sauce is almost ready..



1. If your sauce turns very thick then add some pasta water into the sauce and adjust the consistency. Now add the stir fired veggies and boiled pasta in the sauce. Mix it and adjust the taste of seasonings according to your taste..



1. Now turn off the gas and pasta is ready to serve with garlic bread stick. You can also toast some regular bread with butter and serve it with pasta..
