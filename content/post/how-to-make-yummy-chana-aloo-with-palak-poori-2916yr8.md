Hello everyone welcome to pooja&#39;s sweet home essence today iam going to share with you a recipe of masala palak. Making palak poori or palak paratha is a good way to disguise greens like spinach from kids who do not eat them. Serve palak puri with potato curry or chana masala or aloo rasedar or veg kurma or any veg gravy or curry of your choice. This aloo palak sabzi has always been their favorite and they love this stuffed in kathi rolls, wraps, bread sandwiches and even with lemon rice.
