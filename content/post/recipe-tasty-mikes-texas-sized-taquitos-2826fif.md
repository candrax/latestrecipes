1. After chicken is fully cooked, place in a separate bowl and allow it to cool just slightly..



1. Finely finger shread your chicken..



1. Once shreadded, take 2 tbs of your chicken broth and pour it on your chicken..



1. Sprinkle moistened chicken lightly with the spices you used in your chicken boil, except Mexican Oregeno and lime juice. Also add salt to taste. You&#39;ll need more salt than any other spice but be careful not to over-salt. Mix shreadded chicken..



1. Repeat this same process once more and add 1 cup of shreadded Mexican 3 Cheese..



1. Heat tortillas just slightly in the microwave for 10 seconds. Place chicken mixture on the warmed tortillas end closest to you. Add a line of cheese to the top of your chicken. Press chicken down to firm and begin to roll your tortilla up tightly away from you..
