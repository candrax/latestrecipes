{{< adstxt />}}


1. Fill pot 1/2 way up with Chicken, Beef or Vegetable Stock. Chop all vegetables, add all canned goods [drain those that should be] and place in a very large pot. Add all spices and stir. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer..



1. Fry your Extra Lean Hamburger and drain if necessary. Place in soup pot. This meat ingredient is optional but hamburger is solid protein [almost zero carbohydrates] and it really won&#39;t increase your calories by much. You&#39;ll also need the energy this important protein provides you..



1. Simmer for an hour + or until veggies are somewhat softened. Add additional broth as the soup boils down..



1. IMPORTANT INFORMATION:                                                                                                                   °This massive pot of soup measures approximately 1,500 calories TOTAL and can last an individual dieter up to 7 - 8 days. Remember, most doctors &amp; nutritionists recommend a 1,500 calorie per DAY diet minimum for dieters. Anything less is considered a starvation diet. Once that occurs, your metabolism will panic, hold on tightly to its fat reserve and refuse to lose any additional weight for several weeks. By that time, we&#39;ve just given up. Haven&#39;t we?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           °If you replace 2 meals a day with a generous bowl of this soup - or 4 smaller bowls depending upon your individual preferenc.



1. LOW CARB SNACKS:                                            °Snacks such as celery and cream cheese or peanut butter, in general - most cheeses, seafood cheese based dips [i.e., salmon or crab dip] with veggies, ham or turkey roll ups, pickles, boiled eggs, chicharones, beef jerky and cucumbers are all delicious low carb options.                                                                           °Whatever snack you choose, just make it high in protein, low in carbs and lower in calories. Always focus on carbs before you do calories..



1. OTHER IMPORTANT INFO:                  °Try your best to keep sodium out of this dish. Any salt content will force you to retain a lot of water and have your scale tell you you&#39;re not losing weight. But, also know that the high volumes of water you&#39;ll need to consume will add weight as well. Just be patient with the scale and only weigh yourself once a week. First thing in the morning, completely naked.                                                                                                                                                                               °Also, make another batch when you&#39;ve run out and try to remain on this diet for at least two weeks..



1. OTHER LOW CARB - LOW CALORIE SOUP ADDITION POSSIBILITIES:                                                                                            °Cauliflower, Chives and Seaweed. Other options for zero carb-high protien are chicken, beef slices and seafood..



1. ° If there is a vegetable you don&#39;t enjoy in this recipe, leave it out and replace it ONLY with a comparable carb / calorie vegetable. Otherwise, I can&#39;t guarantee any success. ° Do not assume every vegetable is low in carbs and calories as they are not. MANY vegetables are surprisingly high in carbs. ° Know that thickening agents such as potato flakes, rice, cornstarch, crumbs, barley and flour are very high in carbs so definitely avoid them as well.
