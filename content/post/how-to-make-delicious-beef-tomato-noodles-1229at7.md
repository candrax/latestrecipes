      - Quarter the tomatoes and put them and the mushrooms into a bowl together for later 
      - Now peel the garlic alternatively you can just crush them making removing the skin infinitely easier also this saves you having to crush it after youve peeled it Im an innovator I know put the crushed skinless garlic into the same bowl as the tomatoes and mushrooms 
      - If you havent yet cut the ginger into an inch piece an inch thick I really dont know how to measure out ginger sorry Anyway do it now and slice the inch into the 3 big pieces or finely slice it I dont really like eating ginger and I make big chunks so I know what to keep away Now put it into the bowl from step 3 
      - Chop the spring onions and put in a bowl save it for later 
      - If you bought beef chunks or have already cut the brisket into cubes ignore this but if you havent do it now 
      - Now for the cooking to begin Start by putting the beef into a cold pan fill with cold water just enough to cover the meat by half an inch and bring to boil

      - Fill the pan back up with cold water and repeat step 7 and 8 
      - Now for the actual soup You may need a bigger pan or pot then you used to boil the beef who knows I dont know what pan youre using Anyway in a big pot put in your beef fill with 15 litres of water Throw in the tomato mushroom garlic and ginger from earlier You can also add the mirin soy sauce chicken powder white pepper and the gochujang if you want it spicy if someone youre serving doesnt like the heat just put it into individual bowls later Slightly cover the pot and bring a 
      - Once boiling you can add the eggs just to boil for however long you want themI like them hardboiled Im not saying how long to boil an egg for its basic you should already know 
      - When the eggs are ready take them out and put into ice water to stop cooking further 
      - After removing the eggs turn the heat down and simmer for around 13 hours it all depends on how big or small you cut the beef take a piece out and try it to see how tender it is Also crush the tomatoes into the soup they should be soft enough now and release that flavour 
      - After the eggs have cooled down peel and save for later 
      - After around an hour you can remove the lid to reduce the soup for a thicker richer broth if you wish If not just leave the lid slightly covered until meat is soft and tender 
      - Once the soup is ready and to your taste you can start on the noodles In another pot filled with water and bring to boil 
      - When the water is boiling drop in the noodles the boil until theyre done or if youre using fresh udon like me boil until they separate then drain 
      - Now we can start assembling the dish Begin by putting noodles into the bowl then the meat and mushrooms then add the broth to cover the noodles Finish it off with the spring onions and the egg sliced in half Optional This is the last point you can add the gochujang as well to whoever wants to bring the heat This recipe was a lot longer then I thought Im sorry but if you stayed with me until the end then I hope you enjoy it
