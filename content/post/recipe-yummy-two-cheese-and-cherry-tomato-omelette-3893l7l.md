This made for a light yet filling breakfast with a tasty combination of flavors.

I did sautee the spinach along with a little onion and garlic then added.

Lay the four slices of bread on a clean work surface.

Place one slice of Cheddar on top of two of the slices, evenly divide the tomato slices on top of the cheese, and then finish with the Swiss, one slice.

Tomato omelette gets done in a jiffy and with some homemade brown bread or ready made bread, one gets a healthy as well as nutritious breakfast.
