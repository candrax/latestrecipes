Before you say, &#34;That&#39;s so retro!&#34;, consider why this cake is such a classic: The pineapple topping gets its addictive flavor from melted butter and brown sugarâ€”and yes, maraschino cherries, which we aren&#39;t.

A time when canned pineapple was all the rage.

One look at this cake and you can see why it was so popular.
