### Step by Step Cooking Cabbage rolls

{{< adstxt />}}


1. Add a splash of olive oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Add the onion and fry until they&#39;re soft and browned, about 5 minutes..



1. Add the garlic, tomato paste, Italian seasoning and paprika. Continue frying another 2 minutes..



1. Add the Roma tomatoes and cook until they soften, about 2 minutes. Add the passata, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, a good pinch of salt and several grinds of black pepper. Turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 15 minutes. Add additional seasoning as needed. Set the sauce aside until assembly..



1. Rinse the cabbage and put it in a large pot. Fill the pot with enough cold water so that the cabbage will be submerged without the water spilling over once it boils. Remove the cabbage and put the pot on high heat. Once the water boils, turn the heat down to medium-high to keep it simmering..



1. Put the cabbage in the pot. Wait 2 to 3 minutes until the outermost leaves are softened. Pull the cabbage out and carefully peel off as many leaves as you can. Try to keep them whole. Return the cabbage to the water as needed to keep softening it. Repeat until you have 12 large leaves..

1. In a large bowl, mix all the filling ingredients by hand until well combined..



1. Preheat your oven to 375 F. Line a baking dish (I used a 9 x 13 in dish) with foil and spread a couple of ladlefuls sauce on the bottom..
