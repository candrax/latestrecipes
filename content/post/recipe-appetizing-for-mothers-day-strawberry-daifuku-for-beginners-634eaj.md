1. The finished daifuku will look more smooth and less lumpy if you use koshi-an (smooth sweet red bean paste). If you want to make tsubu-an (chunky sweet red bean paste) into koshi-an, just pass it through a tea strainer..



1. Cover the strawberries with the sweet bean paste. If you leave some parts where you can see the strawberry, the red color will show when the daifuku are done, which will look cute..



1. Put the shiratamako in a microwave-safe container. Add water a little at a time and mix, being careful to break up lumps..



1. Add sugar and mix, again, breaking up lumps. It should turn into a silky liquid..



1. Cover with plastic wrap and heat in a 600W microwave for 3 minutes. Take it out and mix it well using a rubber spatula. It will stick to the spatula, but mix it thoroughly..



1. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave again. Heat for 2 minutes at 500W. Take it out and mix well using a wooden dowel or the equivalent..



1. Stir and pound to mix it well. Mix for a few minutes until the dough becomes shiny and firm..



1. When it becomes firm, spread plastic wrap on a table and sprinkle plenty of katakuriko. Then, transfer the dough onto it. You can also do this on a cutting board..



1. Divide the dough into 4 to 6 portions and flatten each one. If you make the middle a little thicker and the outside a little thinner, it&#39;s easier to wrap the filling..



1. Rather than flattening the dough with your hands, it might be easier to hold the dough up at one end and let gravity do the work..



1. Place the filling from step 3 in the middle of the dough and wrap the dough around it. The wrapped edges should go on the bottom of the daifuku. Pinch the edges together so that they won&#39;t fall apart, and the daifuku are done..
