I found this recipe in a Martha Stewart Holiday magazine and made a few minor adjustments.

Nadia, First of all, the actual cake is very tender and with the jam and cream filling, it is a very moist, light.

This vanilla cake filling is the easiest and fastest cake filling you will ever make.

It tastes like a cross between vanilla mousse cake filling and a cheesecake This coconut cake roll has a creamy filling with coconut essence.

Then there is this lemon meringue cake that is filled with luscious lemon curd.
