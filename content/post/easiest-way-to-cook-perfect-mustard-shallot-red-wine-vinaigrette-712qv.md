### Step by Step Cooking Mustard Shallot Red Wine Vinaigrette

{{< adstxt />}}


1. Put all ingredients *except* oil and stir or whisk to blend everything thoroughly, and at least until all sugar and salt are dissolved.

Give it a taste and adjust seasoning as desired..



1. Then add oil and make sure to give it a really good whisking right before dressing your salad to incorporate the oil with the other ingredients.

The reason I always add oil last is because it&#39;s so much easier to taste the balance of seasonings before the oil&#39;s been added..



1. An optional ingredient you might consider having on hand for dressings is xanthan gum. In *very* small amounts, it&#39;s a great emulsifier, which helps keep the oil and vinegar parts of your dressing in suspension together, i.e., emulsified.

For this quantity of dressing, slurry about 1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum with half a teaspoon of whatever oil you&#39;re using, then pour into the dressing and whisk or blend for 2 to 3 minutes.

Keep in mind that you can&#39;t slurry xanthan gum with water..
