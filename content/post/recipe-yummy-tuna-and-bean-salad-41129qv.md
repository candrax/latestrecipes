**Without fail recipe ultimate Tuna and bean salad easy, delicious, practical**. Simple tuna and white bean salad, a classic combination and so easy to make! Some items that you will almost always find well stocked in our pantry are canned beans (white beans, garbanzo, kidney) and canned tuna packed in olive oil. Put the tuna with its oil, the beans, onion, capers, watercress, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. The authentic version would call for tuna packed in olive oil, but I actually prefer water-packed tuna. Green beans, chunks of tuna, and white kidney beans are mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, and a bit of garlic.
