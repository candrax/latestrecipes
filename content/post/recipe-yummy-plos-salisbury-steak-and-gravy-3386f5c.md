I&#39;d never cooked Salisbury steak before this recipe and don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to to make any changes to it anytime soon.

Loved the gravy and the flavor overall was wonderful.

The name is a little misleading -- these &#34;steaks&#34; are actually ground beef held together with egg and breadcrumbs.

They&#39;re basically single serving patties of meatloaf that are seared and then braised in a savory mushroom gravy.

Lean ground beef and turkey are combined to lighten up this classic, retro American dish.
