### Step by Step Cooking Lamb Madras

{{< adstxt />}}


1. Start by marinading lamb for a few hours using the marinade ingredients. I leave it in a tupperware in the fridge for at least 3 hours..



1. To make the curry sauce cook your diced onions in some olive oil till softened. Then add garlic, ginger and chilli. Then add your spices and cook for a couple of mins. Then add everything else. Simmer for 30 mins or so then pulse the sauce with a hand blender (donâ€™t over blitz so itâ€™s too smooth as itâ€™s nice to have some texture). I also blitz in the same pot I am cooking the sauce in- just be careful not to scratch your pan..



1. Meanwhile, get a hot non stick pan and brown your lamb in hot oil for a few minutes only. Donâ€™t cook the lamb just brown it..



1. Transfer your lamb to the sauce and leave it to cook on the lowest heat for a couple of hours with the lid on. Stir in between a few times and take lid off to thicken. Towards the end of cooking (when the rice is on), add the fresh coriander (stalks and leaves) and spinach leaves. Serve and enjoy ðŸ’•.
