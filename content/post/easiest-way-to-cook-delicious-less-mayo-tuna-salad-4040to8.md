I think lemon juice goes well with tuna so when I add that, I use a bit less mayo and relish.

Fresh lemon juice is best but you can use the concentrate if you prefer.

Carrots - You&#39;ll want your carrots finely chopped so to make that easier, I buy the matchstick cut or shredded carrots and then chop them up from there.

Try wild planet&#39;s wild albacore tuna plus half mayo and half miracle whip.

To me, classic tuna salad has to include tuna, mayo, celery, onions, salt and pepper.
