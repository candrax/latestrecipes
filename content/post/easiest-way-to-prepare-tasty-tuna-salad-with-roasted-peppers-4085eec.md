I added feta cheese to mine.

This Spanish-style tuna salad recipe is elegant and rich, with the addition of roasted red peppers and olive oil, and sherry vinegar.

I love this Spanish tuna salad because it&#39;s different from the types I have usually had- i.e., lots of tuna blended in with finely chopped or saucy ingredients, so.

Make the tuna salad: combine the tuna, celery, Greek yogurt, salt, pepper, and parsley in a medium bowl.

I only made the pepper/tuna part of this recipe, but I absolutely LOVED it!
