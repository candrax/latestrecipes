**Without fail cooking ultimate Parmesan chicken over macaroni and cheese easy, tasty, practical**. My version of chicken parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust. Garlic and parmesan cheese are two of my favorite flavors. They work great with so many foods, like french fries, roasted vegetables and especially pasta! This macaroni and cheese is prepared on the stovetop. After the pasta is cooked, it is coated with a thick and creamy garlic parmesan cheese sauce.
