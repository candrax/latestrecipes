### Process Cooking Chinese Beef Noodle Soup

{{< adstxt />}}


1. (optional) For extra beefy flavour, make beef stock with the bones by boiling them in water with your largest stock pot. After about 5 minutes there will be a lot of scum on top, so use a strainer to skim off the scum every couple of minutes until the stock produces no more foam. It should look a bit green and oily when finished (see pic). Reduce heat to keep it simmering for 1-3 hrs to extract maximum flavour. Alternatively, you can skip this step just use water.



1. While stock is simmering, blanch your beef to remove impurities. In a clean pot, boil just enough water to cover your beef and then add the beef and keep it boiling for 1-2 minutes. Remove the beef, rinse in clean water, cut into eating sized chunks. Discard the scummy water from this step..



1. Make spice ball by placing coriander, fennel, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, orange peel, Szechuan peppercorns, and bay leaves into a spice ball or spice bag..
